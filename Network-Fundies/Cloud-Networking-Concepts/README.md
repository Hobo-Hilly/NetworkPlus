Explain basic corporate and datacenter network architecture.

Cloud Characteristics:
On-Demand Vs. Typical Setup process -EX: I want that network up and running. So Wes, do you just snap your fingers and spare? >> No, we're going to have to do purchasing right? We're going to have to accrue the equipment. We're going to have to figure out and determine where the equipment is gonna sit in our building. Typically some kind of server closet, which means we're either going to have to make space if we don't have space. If we do have space, we're still gonna have to do a rack. 

And stack just meeting, we're gonna have to put it in the rack and then we're gonna have to make the connections and that's where all the cabling is. And I know that just a single drop cable in a building, one drop could cost $120. But then we're gonna have to maybe contact vendor that's gonna accompany that's going to come out here. And they're gonna lay the cabling and then by the time we go lights on we we could be talking a week. Yeah that's if everything runs perfectly.

With Cloud...
So the idea of on-demand is simple, is that when I go and make you know say this is what I need, I begin to get it very quickly by comparison because I'm not having to do all that. I'm requesting it as a service of somehow. And it's gonna actually be that way.

Broad Access:
Broad access so I can reach it from anywhere. Yeah that's a part of it. But it's also about the devices that you can use to build access those resources. Can I get to it from a workstation? Yes you can access those resources. Can I get to it from a laptop? Absolutely. What about my tablet? Yes. What about my smartphone? Yes. And it has to be that idea that it supports broad access and that means that the technology basis there is not really designed for one specific machine and only that particular machine is designed to actually be very free and open to being ought to be used more freely and open by the customer as well. 

Multitenancy:
In cloud computing, multitenancy means that multiple customers of a cloud vendor are using the same computing resources. Despite the fact that they share resources, cloud customers are not aware of each other, and their data is kept totally separate.


Elasticity:
In cloud computing, elasticity is defined as "the degree to which a system is able to adapt to workload changes by provisioning and de-provisioning resources in an autonomic manner, such that at each point in time the available resources match the current demand as closely as possible"

Description:
- Deployment models
    Public:
    Public cloud is an alternative deployment approach to traditional on-premises IT architectures. In the basic public cloud computing model, a third-party provider hosts scalable, on-demand IT resources and delivers them to users over a network connection, either over the public internet or a dedicated network.
    
    Private:
    The private cloud deployment model differs from the public cloud model in that it is a dedicated environment for a single enterprise or organization. Hardware and resources are not shared outside your company. The key difference between a data center and a private cloud is how the resources are managed and provisioned.
    
    Hybrid:
    A hybrid cloud is a mixed computing environment where applications are run using a combination of computing, storage, and services in different environments—public clouds and private clouds, including on-premises data centers or “edge” locations.

    Community:
    A community deployment model largely resembles the private one; the only difference is the set of users. Whereas only one company owns the private cloud server, several organizations with similar backgrounds share the infrastructure and related resources of a community cloud.


- Service models
    Software as a service (SaaS):
    Software as a service is a software licensing and delivery model in which software is licensed on a subscription basis and is centrally hosted. SaaS is also known as on-demand software, web-based software, or web-hosted software.
    
    Infrastructure as a service (IaaS):
    Infrastructure as a service is a cloud computing service model by means of which computing resources are supplied by a cloud services provider. The IaaS vendor provides the storage, network, servers, and virtualization. This service enables users to free themselves from maintaining an on-premises data center.
    
    Platform as a service (PaaS):
    Platform as a service (PaaS) is a cloud computing model where a third-party provider delivers hardware and software tools to users over the internet. Platform as a service (PaaS) or application platform as a service (aPaaS) or platform-based service is a category of cloud computing services that allows customers to provision, instantiate, run, and manage a modular bundle comprising a computing platform and one or more applications, without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching the application(s), and to allow developers to create, develop, and package such software bundles.
    
    Desktop as a service (DaaS):
    Desktop as a Service (DaaS) is a cloud computing offering where a service provider delivers virtual desktops to end users over the Internet, licensed with a per-user subscription.

- Infrastructure as code
    Automation/orchestration

- Connectivity options
    Virtual private network (VPN)
    Private-direct connection to cloud provider

- Scalability:
Cloud scalability in cloud computing refers to the ability to increase or decrease IT resources as needed to meet changing demand. Scalability is one of the hallmarks of the cloud and the primary driver of its exploding popularity with businesses.

- Security implications:
Data Loss:
Data loss is the most common cloud security risks of cloud computing. It is also known as data leakage. Data loss is the process in which data is being deleted, corrupted, and unreadable by a user, software, or application. In a cloud computing environment, data loss occurs when our sensitive data is somebody else's hands, one or more data elements can not be utilized by the data owner, hard disk is not working properly, and software is not updated.

Hacked Interfaces and Insecure APIs:
As we all know, cloud computing is completely depends on Internet, so it is compulsory to protect interfaces and APIs that are used by external users. APIs are the easiest way to communicate with most of the cloud services. In cloud computing, few services are available in the public domain. These services can be accessed by third parties, so there may be a chance that these services easily harmed and hacked by hackers.

Data Breach:
Data Breach is the process in which the confidential data is viewed, accessed, or stolen by the third party without any authorization, so organization's data is hacked by the hackers.

Vendor lock-in:
Vendor lock-in is the of the biggest security risks in cloud computing. Organizations may face problems when transferring their services from one vendor to another. As different vendors provide different platforms, that can cause difficulty moving one cloud to another.

Increased complexity strains IT staff:
Migrating, integrating, and operating the cloud services is complex for the IT staff. IT staff must require the extra capability and skills to manage, integrate, and maintain the data to the cloud.

Spectre & Meltdown:
Spectre & Meltdown allows programs to view and steal data which is currently processed on computer. It can run on personal computers, mobile devices, and in the cloud. It can store the password, your personal information such as images, emails, and business documents in the memory of other running programs.

Denial of Service (DoS) attacks:
Denial of service (DoS) attacks occur when the system receives too much traffic to buffer the server. Mostly, DoS attackers target web servers of large organizations such as banking sectors, media companies, and government organizations. To recover the lost data, DoS attackers charge a great deal of time and money to handle the data.

Account hijacking:
Account hijacking is a serious security risk in cloud computing. It is the process in which individual user's or organization's cloud account (bank account, e-mail account, and social media account) is stolen by hackers. The hackers use the stolen account to perform unauthorized activities.
