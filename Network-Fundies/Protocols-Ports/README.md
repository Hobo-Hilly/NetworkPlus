Episode: Protocols and Ports
Learner Objectives:

Explain common ports and protocols, their application, and encrypted alternatives

Description:In this episode, the viewer will identify common TCP and UDP protocols as well as the ports associated with each. Also, the viewer with examine IP protocol type identifiers.

What are protocols?
In general, protocol essentially is a set of rules for communication. For instance in client server networks that we have clients that are asking for resources and servers that are providing those resources. When a host asks for those resources, it's going to ask (depending on the resource that being asked for), it's going to ask it in a certain language. And that's the rule, the structured mean for communications.

What are ports and why do we use them?
Applications identify which communication application is performing and they identify those logical endpoints through the port values, the port numbers. 

Summary:
So protocols, a structure rule set of rules for communication, pork values allows applications to identify logical endpoints of connections.
