Topic: Network Implementations Episode: Wireless Technologies Learner Objectives:

Given a scenario, install and configure the appropriate wireless standards and technologies

Description:In this episode, the viewer will identify technologies associated with wireless networks such as service set identifier variants like basic service set, extended service set and independant basic service sets. The viewer will also compare and constrast wireless antenna types like directional and omni-directionals as well as channel bonding, MIMO and MU-MIMO.


Service set identifier (SSID):
A service set identifier (SSID) is a sequence of characters that uniquely names a Wi-Fi network. An SSID is sometimes referred to as a network name. This name allows stations to connect to the desired network when multiple independent networks operate in the same physical area.

Basic service set:
The Basic Service Set is a term used to describe the collection of Stations which may communicate together within an 802.11 network. The BSS may or may not include AP (Access Point) which provide a connection onto a fixed distribution system such as an Ethernet network.

Extended service set:
An extended service set (ESS) is one or more interconnected basic service sets (BSSs) and their associated LANs. Each BSS consists of a single access point (AP) together with all wireless client devices (stations, also called STAs) creating a local or enterprise 802.11 wireless LAN (WLAN).

Independent basic service set (Ad-hoc):
A Independent Basic Service Set (IBSS) forms an ad hoc, independent, self-contained network with station-to-station traffic flowing directly, receiving data transmitted by another station, and only filtering traffic based on the MAC address of the receiver

Roaming:
Roaming lets you talk, text and go online when you're outside of your wireless provider's coverage area. With roaming, your data can travel on the network of another provider to give you the wireless connectivity you want.

Antenna types:
The three main antenna types are omnidirectional, semi-directional, and highly directional.

Omni:
An omnidirectional antenna is a wireless transmitting or receiving antenna that radiates or intercepts radio-frequency (RF) electromagnetic fields equally well in all horizontal directions in a flat, two-dimensional (2D) geometric plane.

Directional:
Directional antennas send and receive signals in one direction only, usually in a tightly focused, very narrow beam. The signal pattern from a directional antenna has a cigar shape, and looks the same from the top as from the sides. This shape is referred to as a lobe.

Channel bonding:
Channel bonding is a practice commonly used in IEEE 802.11 implementations in which two adjacent channels within a given frequency band are combined to increase throughput between two or more wireless devices.

Multiple input, multiple output (MIMO) and multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO):
Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) is a wireless technology that uses multiple transmitters and receivers to transfer more data at the same time. All wireless products with 802.11n support MIMO. The technology helps allow 802.11n to reach higher speeds than products without 802.11n.
