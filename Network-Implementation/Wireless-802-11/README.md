Description:In this episode, the viewer will identify the standards set forth by the IEEE for wireless local area network (WLAN) under 802.11.
802.11 Wireless Standards
802.11 represents the IEEE designation for wireless networking. Several wireless networking specifications exist under the 802.11 banner. The Network+ objectives focus on 802.11, 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, and 802.11n. All these standards use the Ethernet protocol and the CSMA/CA access method.

!!!!!  Exam Alert  !!!!!
The Network+ exam will have questions on the characteristics of the wireless standards. Remember, 802.11 wireless standards use the CSMA/CA access method.



The 802.11 wireless standards can differ in terms of speed, transmission ranges, and frequency used, but in terms of actual implementation they are similar. All standards can use either an infrastructure or ad hoc network design, and each can use the same security protocols. 




802.11 standards

802.11:
There were actually two variations on the initial 802.11 wireless standard. Both offered 1 or 2Mbps transmission speeds and the same RF of 2.4GHz. The difference between the two was in how data traveled through the RF media. One used FHSS, and the other used DSSS. The original 802.11 standards are far too slow for modern networking needs and are now no longer deployed.

802.11a:
In terms of speed, the 802.11a standard was far ahead of the original 802.11 standards. 802.11a specified speeds of up to 54Mbps in the 5GHz band, but most commonly, communication takes place at 6Mbps, 12Mbps, or 24Mbps. 802.11a is incompatible with the 802.11b and 802.11g wireless standards.

802.11b:
The 802.11b standard provides for a maximum transmission speed of 11Mbps. However, devices are designed to be backward-compatible with previous 802.11 standards that provided for speeds of 1, 2, and 5.5Mbps. 802.11b uses a 2.4GHz RF range and is compatible with 802.11g.

802.11g:
802.11g is a popular wireless standard today. 802.11g offers wireless transmission over distances of 150 feet and speeds up to 54Mbps compared with the 11Mbps of the 802.11b standard. Like 802.11b, 802.11g operates in the 2.4GHz range and therefore is compatible with it.

802.11n (WiFi 4):
 The newest of the wireless standards listed in the Network+ objectives is 802.11n. The goal of the 802.11n standard is to significantly increase throughput in both the 2.4GHz and the 5GHz frequency range. The baseline goal of the standard was to reach speeds of 100Mbps, but given the right conditions, it is estimated that the 802.11n speeds might reach a staggering 600Mbps. In practical operation, 802.11n speeds will be much slower.


Note: Channel surfing
In wireless networking a single channel is 20MHz in width. When two channels are bonded, they are a total of 40MHz. 802.11n systems can use either the 20MHz channels or the 40MHz channel.


802.11ac (WiFi 5):
What is 802.11n?
802.11n is a Wi-Fi standard introduced in 2009. In comparison with earlier Wi-Fi standards, it allowed for improved wireless computing, video conferencing, HD streaming, and dynamic web-based apps. But as network traffic and performance demands grew, 802.11n reached its practical capacity.

How does 802.11ac work?
802.11ac uses several new technologies to improve performance over 802.11n:

Additional spatial streams: 802.11n used four spatial streams and 40-MHz channel widths to achieve multiple input, multiple output (MIMO). But 802.11ac uses eight spatial streams and channels up to 80 MHz wide. To support MIMO, routers are increasingly designed with multiple antennas.
256 quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM): 802.11ac uses 256 QAM, compared with the 64 QAM of 802.11n. That means 802.11ac squeezes 256 signals onto one frequency, through subtle phasing of the signals. In theory, 802.11ac quadruples the spectral efficiency of 802.11n.
Beamforming: This technology sends transmissions directionally rather than transmitting 360 degrees, as most wireless technology did until the arrival of 802.11ac. Beamforming is achieved by use of multiple antennas on the router and by the antennas' physically adjusting themselves for transmission in certain directions.
Is 802.11ac backward- and forward-compatible?
Each new Wi-Fi standard effectively absorbs previous versions. Depending on client hardware or network conditions, 802.11ac operates with 802.11n and any other previous 802 standard when necessary.

This compatibility will extend forward as well: Wi-Fi 6 will be backward-compatible with 802.11ac, with performance conforming to the older standard.

How fast is 802.11ac?
802.11ac transmits at a top speed of 1300 Mbps, almost three times faster than the 450 Mbps of 802.11n.

As with many network performance specs, the actual speed achieved will likely not approach the top theoretical speeds. Variations in hardware, network architecture, applications used, and even the composition of office walls can have huge effects on Wi-Fi performance.

What are advantages of 802.11ac over 802.11n?
With its new 5-GHz spectrum, 802.11ac achieves faster speeds for data throughput and provides more bandwidth for additional computers, wireless devices, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices to come online.

By switching between 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz bands, 802.11ac can dynamically optimize network performance based on network usage. And by using beamforming, 802.11ac results in less interference for transmissions and lower power demands from routers.

How does 802.11ac differ from Wi-Fi 6?
Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) represents a significant upgrade over 802.11ac. It provides improvements in all performance specifications and offers additional technologies.
Benefits of 802.11ac
Data network improvements such as the ones that 802.11ac delivers can benefit organizations in multiple ways:

Data speeds
User productivity benefit from 802.11ac's boost in data transmission speeds.

Capacity
802.11ac provides the extra capacity needed for growth in scale or scope of business activity and for increases in numbers of connected devices.

Application response
802.11ac's lower latency means that dynamic web-based applications respond faster, increasing productivity and inviting the use of more web apps.

Beyond 802.11ac: Upgrading to Wi-Fi 6
Wi-Fi 6, also known as 802.11ax, is the successor to 802.11ac. Wi-Fi 6 offers several improvements over its predecessor:

Higher capacity
Network users can attach up to four times more devices than under previous standards, thanks to features such as orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) and multiuser multiple input, multiple output (MU-MIMO). Wi-Fi 6 communicates in parallel with multiple devices; the previous standards communicate with only one device at a time.

The increased device support is essential because the volume of mobile data traffic is expected to grow significantly over the coming years.

Improved power efficiency
Devices that support the Wi-Fi 6 standard consume two-thirds less power. This means that batteries in products such as smartphones, laptops, tablets, and IoT devices can last longer.

Improved security
Wi-Fi Protected Access 3 (WPA3) is certified with Wi-Fi 6 and provides greater value than WPA2 for enterprise Wi-Fi networks. It offers enhanced security for open Wi-Fi networks encryption of unauthenticated traffic, robust password protection against brute-force attacks, and superior data reliability for sensitive information 192-bit encryption.

Increased speed
Wi-Fi 6 offers up to four times the throughput, on average, in congested wireless environments.

802.11ax (WiFi 6):
What are the benefits of 802.11ax?
802.11ax allows enterprises and service providers to support new and emerging applications on the same wireless LAN (WLAN) infrastructure, while delivering a higher grade of service to older applications. This scenario sets the stage for new business models and increased Wi-Fi adoption.

Is 802.11ax different from Wi-Fi 6?
No, they are the same thing. The Wi-Fi Alliance started a campaign to coin the term “Wi-Fi 6” when referring to the IEEE 802.11ax standard. It indicates that the standard is the sixth generation of Wi-Fi. The premise was that simplification of the marketing message could help Wi-Fi be better positioned relative to the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standards used in cellular (such as 5G wireless technology).

When will the 802.11ax standard be ratified?
The IEEE-Standards Association is currently scheduled to ratify the final IEEE 802.11ax amendment in the middle of 2020. However, the Wi-Fi Alliance is expected to certify key features from the amendment in about August 2019, with additional features (including operation in the 6GHz band) certified over the next couple of years.

Components of 802.11ax
802.11ax benefits
802.11ax will let access points support more clients in dense environments and will provide a better experience for typical wireless LAN networks. It will also provide a more predictable performance for advanced applications such as 4K or 8K video, high-density high-definition collaboration apps, all-wireless offices, and the Internet of Things (IoT). 802.11ax will drive Wi-Fi toward the future as the growth of wireless continues.

802.11ax access points
There are some 802.11ax access points already on the market targeted for early adopters and customers who are eager to test the new standard. The access points that are released early will be pre-standard APs because the standard will not yet have been ratified. This means key features that are part of 802.11ax may not be supported on some of these initial, pre-standard access points. However, when available, some of these access points will be able to become certified through software updates and 802.11ax features will be supported. This approach is similar to the introduction of prior generations such 802.11ac and 802.11n.

802.11ax compatibility with 802.11ac
As with every other recent Wi-Fi advance, 802.11ax is backward compatible, building on existing technologies. 

What is DSSS?:
In telecommunications, direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) is a spread-spectrum modulation technique primarily used to reduce overall signal interference. The direct-sequence modulation makes the transmitted signal wider in bandwidth than the information bandwidth. After the despreading or removal of the direct-sequence modulation in the receiver, the information bandwidth is restored, while the unintentional and intentional interference is substantially reduced.

What is FHSS?:
1. Frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) is repeated switching of carrier frequency during radio transmission to reduce interference and avoid interception.

2. Frequency-hopping spread spectrum is a method of transmitting radio signals by rapidly changing the carrier frequency among many frequencies occupying a large spectral band. The changes are controlled by a code known to both transmitter and receiver.

What is OFDM?:
Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is a multi-carrier modulation system where data is transmitted as a combination of orthogonal narrowband signals known as subcarriers. OFDM builds upon single carrier modulation such as QAM and can transmit at similar data rates.

Frequencies and range

2.4GHz:
about 2,400 to 2,483.5 Mhz
The 2.4 GHz band, which runs from about 2,400 to 2,483.5 Mhz, is where routers have to live.

5GHz:
5GHz frequency band
5GHz transmission ranges from 5.15GHz to 5.35GHz and 5.725GHz to 5.85GHz. The available channels on the 5GHz band vary depending on countries and regions; for example, there are 13 available non-overlapping channels in China. The 5GHz frequency band has channels numbered 36 to 165 channels.

NOTE:
What Is an Ad Hoc Network?
five hands fist bumping over laptops connected via an ad hoc network
Connecting two computers does not always require a centrally managed network. Instead, users can set up an ad hoc network between two computers. The two devices communicate through an ethernet cable or wireless cards. However, this connection is only temporary.

How Does an Ad Hoc Network Work?
Let’s say that Adam needs to transfer a file over to his friend, Eve, but doesn’t have access to a safe Wi-Fi connection. He can create an ad hoc network instead.

An ad hoc network is a temporary type of Local Area Network (LAN). If you set up an ad hoc network permanently, it becomes a LAN.

Multiple devices can use an ad hoc network at the same time, but this might cause a lull in performance. Users can also employ an ad hoc network to access the internet, as long as the hosting device can access the internet. This might be useful if only one small area of a location can access the internet, but multiple people need to get online.

With an ad hoc network, several devices can share the host device’s internet access. Employers typically pay well for jobs that manage this sort of network, especially in fields that demand a lot of travel.

Adam can create an ad hoc network between his and Eve’s laptops wirelessly, as long as it is within 100 meters (about 328 feet). From that point, he can transfer files to Eve’s laptop.

However, since Adam’s computer is the hosting device, the connection between the two devices will end when Adam ends the session, no matter how many devices are connected to the ad hoc network at the time.

Ad Hoc Connection Security
One of the biggest concerns with an ad hoc network is security. If cyber-attackers get within signal range, they will generally be able to connect to a wireless ad hoc network and, therefore, to the device.

Furthermore, users cannot disable their SSID broadcast in ad hoc mode, meaning that the network name cannot be hidden if users are in a public place. For this reason, ad hoc networks are not always appropriate.

However, because ad hoc connections are temporary and only accessible within 100 meters, they can be ideal for some situations. Attackers cannot hack into a device from far away and do not have unlimited time to plan their attack.
