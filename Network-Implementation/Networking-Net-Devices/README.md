 Topic: Network Implementations Episode: Networking and Networked Devices Learner Objectives:

Compare and contrast various devices, their features, and their appropriate placement on the network.

Description:

Networking devices:
Layer 2 switch:
A layer 2 switch is a type of network switch or device that works on the data link layer (OSI Layer 2) and utilizes MAC Address to determine the path through where the frames are to be forwarded. It uses hardware based switching techniques to connect and transmit data in a local area network (LAN).

Layer 3 capable switch:
Simply put, a layer 3 switch combines the functionality of a switch and a router. It acts as a switch to connect devices that are on the same subnet or virtual LAN at lightning speeds and has IP routing intelligence built into it to double up as a router. It can support routing protocols, inspect incoming packets, and can even make routing decisions based on the source and destination addresses. This is how a layer 3 switch acts as both a switch and a router.

NOTE:Often referred to as a multilayer switch, a layer 3 switch adds a ton of flexibility to a network.

Router:
A router is a commonly utilised Layer 3 device. Operating at Layer 3, a router will inspect the IP and IPX addresses of incoming data packets. After determining the packet source, the router will then make routing decisions based on the enclosed destination address and quality of service specifications.

Hub:
An Ethernet hub, active hub, network hub, repeater hub, multiport repeater, or simply hub is a network hardware device for connecting multiple Ethernet devices together and making them act as a single network segment.

Access point:
An access point is a device that creates a wireless local area network, or WLAN, usually in an office or large building. An access point connects to a wired router, switch, or hub via an Ethernet cable, and projects a WiFi signal to a designated area. For example, if you want to enable WiFi access in your company's reception area but donâ€™t have a router within range, you can install an access point near the front desk and run an Ethernet cable through the ceiling back to the server room.

Bridge:
A network bridge is a computer networking device that creates a single, aggregate network from multiple communication networks or network segments.

Wireless LAN controller:
A WLAN is a wireless architecture that aims to meet changing network demands. A WLAN controller manages wireless network access points that allow wireless devices to connect to the network.

EX: What a wireless access point does for your network is similar to what an amplifier does for your home stereo. It takes the bandwidth coming from a router and stretches it so that many devices can go on the network from farther distances away.

Load balancer:
Load balancing refers to efficiently distributing incoming network traffic across a group of backend servers, also known as a server farm or server pool.

Proxy server:
In computer networking, a proxy server is a server application that acts as an intermediary between a client requesting a resource and the server providing that resource.

Cable modem:
Cable modems are a prevalent type of hardware that connects computer devices with your ISP. Differing from other types of modems, a cable modem uses coax cable, the same infrastructure that brings television programming to our business or homes, to proxy that connection, rather than a telephone or DSL line.

DSL modem:
A modem router is a combination device that functions as both modem and router. You usually need a modem and a router to connect to the ISP and provides internet to other devices. A DSL modem router has both built into one box. DSL is an initialism for "Digital Subscriber Line", which is a technology that enables high-speed data transmission on ordinary twisted-pair telephone lines.

In short, a DSL modem router converts the DSL line to an Ethernet connection and shares the wireless network directly.


Repeater:
A repeater is implemented in computer networks to expand the coverage area of the network, repropagate a weak or broken signal and or service remote nodes. Repeaters amplify the received/input signal to a higher frequency domain so that it is reusable, scalable and available.

Voice gateway:
The voice gateway is used to connect the enterprise VoIP network with the telecommunications provider, using a number of different connectivity methods, such as PSTN, ISDN and SIP. In many cases, voice gateways are also used as "interfacing devices" between old analog devices and the VoIP infrastructure.

Media converter:
A media converter is a networking device that connects two different media, like Ethernet copper and Ethernet fiber. Typically, they connect devices that are beyond 100 meters from the nearest available switch.

===================== Security =======================================

Intrusion prevention system (IPS)/intrusion detection system (IDS) device:
IPS- An intrusion prevention system (IPS) is a network security tool (which can be a hardware device or software) that continuously monitors a network for malicious activity and takes action to prevent it, including reporting, blocking, or dropping it, when it does occur.

IDS- An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a monitoring system that detects suspicious activities and generates alerts when they are detected. Based upon these alerts, a security operations center (SOC) analyst or incident responder can investigate the issue and take the appropriate actions to remediate the threat.

Firewall:
A Firewall is a network security device that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on an organization's previously established security policies. At its most basic, a firewall is essentially the barrier that sits between a private internal network and the public Internet.

VPN headend:
The VPN headend is where the IPSec tunnel terminates in the Oracle Cloud. It is part of the DRG but for simplicity it is represented in Figure 4 as separate components to help you understand the concept. When you configure VPN Connect Oracle by default provides two headends for redundancy.
