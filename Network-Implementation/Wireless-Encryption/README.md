Topic: Network Implementations Episode: Wireless Technologies Learner Objectives:

Given a scenario, install and configure the appropriate wireless standards and technologies

Description:In this episode, the viewer will identify wireless encryption standards that are used to protect data on wireless networks. The viewer will compare and contrast the strengths and weaknesses of WPS, WPA, WPA2, TKIP, CCMP and the difference between personal and enterprise modes.

Encryption standards:
WEP, WPA, and WPA2 are Wi-Fi security protocols that secure wireless connections. They keep your data hidden and protect your communications, while blocking hackers from your network. Generally, WPA2 is the best choice, even though it consumes more processing power to protect your network.

WiFi Protected Access:
Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) is a security standard for computing devices equipped with wireless internet connections. WPA was developed by the Wi-Fi Alliance to provide more sophisticated data encryption and better user authentication than Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), the original Wi-Fi security standard.

WPA2 Personal:
Wi-Fi Protected Access 2—Pre-Shared-Key, often known as WPA2-Personal, is a type of encryption that uses either the TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol) or AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) encryption mechanism to safeguard network access and data transfer.

AES:
What is AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) Encryption?
In short, AES is a symmetric type of encryption, as it uses the same key to both encrypt and decrypt data.

It also uses the SPN (substitution permutation network) algorithm, applying multiple rounds to encrypt data. These encryption rounds are the reason behind the impenetrability of AES, as there are far too many rounds to break through.

There are three lengths of AES encryption keys. Each key length has a different number of possible key combinations:

128-bit key length: 3.4 x 1038
192-bit key length: 6.2 x 1057
256-bit key length: 1.1 x 1077
Even though the key length of this encryption method varies, its block size - 128-bits (or 16 bytes) - stays fixed. 

The variety of key lengths poses some questions. Why are there multiple key lengths? And, if the 256-bit key is the strongest of the bunch (even referred to as “military-grade” encryption), why don’t we just always use it?

Well, it all comes down to resources. For example, an app that uses AES-256 instead of AES-128 might drain your phone battery a bit faster.

Luckily, current technology makes the resource difference so minuscule that there is simply no reason not to use 256-bit AES encryption.

Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP):
TKIP (short for Temporal Key Integrity Protocol) is an encryption method. TKIP provides per-packet key mixing a message integrity and re-keying mechanism.

WPA/WPA2 Enterprise (AES/TKIP)
WPA2 is the latest security protocol developed by the Wi-Fi Alliance. There are two versions of WPA2, Personal and Enterprise. Both use a strong encryption method called AES-CCMP to encrypt data transmitted over the air. The main difference between these security modes is in the authentication stage.

CCMP:
Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol (CCMP) is an encryption protocol based on the U.S. federal government's Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm and uses the Counter Mode with CBC-MAC (CCM) mode of operation.

NOTE: What is CCMP in wireless?
CCMP stands for Counter Mode CBC-MAC Protocol . CCMP, also known as AES CCMP, is the encryption mechanism that has replaced TKIP, and it is the security standard used with WPA2 wireless networks.
