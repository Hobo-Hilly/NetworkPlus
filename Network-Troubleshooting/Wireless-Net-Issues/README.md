Topic: Network Troubleshooting
Episode: Wireless Network Considerations Learner Objectives:

Given a scenario, troubleshoot common wireless connectivity issues.

Description: In this episode, the viewer will identify wireless limitations such as throughput, speed distance, received signal strength indication (RSSI). The viewer will also identify common considerations issues such as interference, channel overlap, attenuation and client disassociation issues. The viewer will also identify common configuration issues such as wrong SSID, wrong passphrases and encryption mismatch issues.

Common issues
Interference
Placement
Absorbtion, reflection, refraction
RF attentuation and signal loss
Insufficient wireless coverage
Channel overlap
Channel Utilization (level of traffic the AP percieves, including chatter or other APs and clients)
Cochannel Contention
Antenna cable attenuation/signal loss
resistance in the conductors
the current flowing in the conductors
Cable damage
Defective antennas
RF attenuation/signal loss
Polarization mismatch
Antenna types
RSSI is how well the AP can hear a connected client
RSSI is useful for AP handoffs and always defined by the client
RSSI is defined by signal strength, noise level, and bit-error rate. With the most important variable being received signal strenth.
Client disassociation issues
Client kicked for inactivity
No communication from client, client fails to notify the AP that it shoud be dropped from the association table
Client deauthentication issues
Client(STA) has left the BSS or ESS without indicating to the AP, such as sleep mode
Configuration Issues
Wrong SSID
Incorrect passphrase
Encryption protocol mismatch
Captive portal issues
