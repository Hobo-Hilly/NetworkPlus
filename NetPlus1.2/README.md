1.2 Network + notes with Professor Messer


Network Topologies

Useful in planning a new network
- Physical layout of a building or campus

Assists in understanding signal flow
- Troubleshooting problems



Star Topology AKA Hub and Spoke 

EX: A switch at the center of a network with multiple devices connected to it.
HUB == Switch
Spokes == Devices directly connected to the switch

Ring Topologies
- Token Ring is no longer with us

Still used in many
Metro Area Networks (MANs)
and Wide Area Networks (WANs)

-Dual-rings
-Built-in fault tolerance

Bus Topologies
*Early local area network
-   Coaxial cable was the bus

Simple, but prone to errors
-   One break in the link disabled
    the entire network

Controller Area Network Buses
-   CAN bus 
These are uses to connect all of the different sensors within an automobile. A lot of safety features

Mesh Network

Multiple links to the same place
- Fully connected
- Partially connected

Redundancy, fault-tolerance, load balancing

Used in wide area networks (WANs)
-   Fully meshed and partially meshed
The most common place to find a mesh network is in a WAN
This allows you to create multiple links to other sites so that you can have a primary connection
from one site to the other. AND a backup connection should one connection go down the network will heal itself and use the other direction or second path to the resource since the primary route is down or unavailable.

Hyrbid Network
This is when you combind more than one of these toplogies with the other it is considered a hybrid network.

For example: you may have three remote sites all connecting devices together using a switched network in a star topology. 
Which connects to each other over a WAN or Wide Area Network in a RING topology.


Wireless topologies
Infrastructure mode
-   All devices communicate through an access point (AP)
-   The most common wireless communication mode


If you have two devices or more and you have no access point you can connect the devices directly two each other using add hoc mode
Ad hoc networking
- no pre-existing infrastucture
- Devices communication amongst themselves


IoT devices internet of things
Wireless devices that control our
These devices all work together to control lights,door locks, thermastats.  
All of these devices can communicate with eachother on the network simultaneously.
This creates an interconnected mesh between all of these IoT devices.
- One advantage is that it allows many devices to communicate with each other even if the devices are very far apart from each other
- This also allows the mesh network to self heal.
    so if you turn off one of those IoT devices the network will self heal and redesign itself into a NEW mesh network that will allow them to 
    continue communication.
